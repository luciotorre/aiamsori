...<br>
*done*	create_ray_to_wall_collision(wallmask, tilesize)<br>
*done*	ray_to_wall_collision((x0,y0),(hx,hy)) ; first pair origin, second direction<br>
<br>
need:<br>
curr	build wallmask at loadmap<br>
curr	obtain tilesize at loadmap<br>
<br>
Later:
	augment ray_to_wall_collision to 
	fatray_to_wall_collision((x0,y0),(hx,hy),r) # r ray diameter

	fn_visibles becomes trivial:
	fn_visibles = fatray_to_wall_collision(a,b,a.radius)

Later:
	add wptnav member to GameLayer, will provide nav services
	Zombie uses wptnav to move
